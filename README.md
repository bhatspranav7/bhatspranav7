👋 Hi, I’m Pranav S Bhat

🎓 3rd Year ISE Student at Vidyavardhaka College of Engineering, Mysuru
💻 Backend Engineer | ML & AI Systems Enthusiast

I’m a developer who enjoys building scalable backend systems and intelligent ML-powered applications. My primary interest lies at the intersection of backend architecture, machine learning, and AI-driven products — turning ideas into production-ready systems.

🚀 What I Work On

🔹 Backend Development

Designing RESTful & async APIs

Building scalable systems with FastAPI, Node.js, Firebase

Database design & optimization (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis)

Authentication, role-based access, real-time systems

🔹 Machine Learning & AI

ML pipelines: data preprocessing → modeling → evaluation

Applied ML for prediction, clustering, and analytics

Generative AI & LLM-based systems

AI-driven products (demand forecasting, prediction engines, assistants)

🔹 System Thinking

Clean architecture & modular design

Performance, scalability, and reliability

API-first and data-driven development

🧠 Current Interests

AI system design & ML architecture

Backend-heavy products with real-world impact

Large-scale data handling & prediction systems

Building end-to-end projects (idea → backend → ML → deployment)
